🌐 What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser?

Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes the moment you type a URL and press Enter? Modern web applications rely on a complex stack of technologies to deliver content quickly, securely, and reliably. Let’s break down the journey of a request to https://www.google.com.



1️⃣ DNS Request

 Your browser asks a DNS server to translate www.google.com into an IP address. Think of DNS as the phonebook of the internet — your computer needs the server’s “number” to connect.



2️⃣ TCP/IP Connection

 Once the IP is known, your browser establishes a TCP connection. TCP ensures that data packets are delivered reliably and in order. This involves a “three-way handshake” between your device and the server.



3️⃣ Firewall Checks

 Your request passes through firewalls, which inspect incoming and outgoing traffic to prevent unauthorized access and protect both your device and the server.



4️⃣ HTTPS/SSL Encryption

 Because the URL starts with HTTPS, the browser performs an SSL/TLS handshake with the server. This:

Verifies the server’s identity

Encrypts the data, keeping sensitive information private



5️⃣ Load Balancer

 At Google’s massive data centers, a load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers. It ensures:

No single server is overloaded

Traffic is rerouted if a server fails



6️⃣ Web Server

 The web server handles static content like images, CSS, and JavaScript. For dynamic requests, it forwards them to the application server.



7️⃣ Application Server

 The application server executes business logic. For example, it handles your search queries and prepares the data to be displayed.



8️⃣ Database

 The application server communicates with the database to fetch or store data. In Google’s case, this means querying the search index to return relevant results.



9️⃣ Response Back to the Browser

 Finally, the response travels back through the load balancer → HTTPS → firewall → browser, where the page is rendered for you to see.



💡 Key Takeaway:

 From a single URL to a fully rendered page, dozens of components work seamlessly together. Understanding this workflow — DNS, TCP/IP, firewall, HTTPS, load balancer, web server, application server, database — is essential for software engineers, front-end developers, and site reliability engineers alike.
