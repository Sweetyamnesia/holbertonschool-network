What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser

Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes the moment you type a URL into your browser and press Enter? Modern web applications rely on a complex stack of technologies to deliver content quickly, securely, and reliably. In this post, I will walk you through the journey of a simple request to https://www.google.com and explain each step in the web stack.

1. DNS Request

The first step is DNS resolution. When you type www.google.com, your browser asks a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the human-readable domain into an IP address. This is necessary because computers communicate using IP addresses, not domain names. Your computer may check its local cache first; if the address is not found, it queries a recursive DNS server, which eventually finds the authoritative DNS server for Google and returns the IP address.

2. TCP/IP Connection

Once the IP address is known, your browser establishes a TCP connection with the server. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data packets. During this process, your device and the server perform a "three-way handshake" to agree on the connection parameters.

3. Firewall Checks

Before reaching the server, your request may pass through firewalls, both on your local network and at the server side. Firewalls inspect incoming and outgoing packets to ensure only allowed traffic reaches its destination, providing security and preventing malicious access.

4. HTTPS/SSL Encryption

Because the URL starts with https://, the browser establishes a secure HTTPS connection using SSL/TLS. This process involves verifying the server’s certificate to ensure the site is legitimate and encrypting data to protect privacy. The encrypted connection ensures that sensitive information like passwords or search queries cannot be intercepted by third parties.

5. Load Balancer

Google operates massive data centers with thousands of servers. A load balancer sits between the internet and the servers, distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to optimize performance and prevent any single server from being overloaded. Load balancers can also detect failing servers and reroute traffic automatically to healthy ones, ensuring high availability.

6. Web Server

Once the request reaches a server, the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) handles the HTTP request. For static content such as images, CSS, or JavaScript, the web server may respond directly. For dynamic requests, it forwards them to the application server.

7. Application Server

The application server executes the core business logic. For example, it handles search queries, performs computations, and determines what data needs to be fetched from the database. It processes the request, prepares the response, and sends it back to the web server for delivery to the browser.

8. Database

Dynamic websites often rely on a database to store and retrieve data. In Google’s case, the search index is queried to find relevant results. The application server communicates with the database, retrieves the necessary information, and formats it for the user.

9. Response Back to the Browser

After processing, the response travels back through the load balancer, over the secure HTTPS connection, through any firewalls, and finally arrives at your browser. The browser interprets the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, rendering the page you see.

Conclusion

From typing a URL to seeing a fully rendered webpage, dozens of systems work together seamlessly. This workflow touches on DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases—all critical components of modern web architecture. Understanding this flow not only improves your technical knowledge but also prepares you for interviews and real-world engineering challenges.
